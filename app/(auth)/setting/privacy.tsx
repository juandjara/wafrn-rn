          {"\n\n"}
          Regarding what we will do with your data:
          {"\n\n"}
          We are connected with other social networks, so your posts and your images could be automatically stored in other servers. Your URL, your blog name and your avatar are public information. Your birth date, email and password are private and only get stored in our server.
          {"\n\n"}
          We will store your email and every once in a while send you a small campaing so you come back and commit some shitposts (please).
          {"\n\n"}
          We need your birth date for legal reasons. Mostly to verify that you are older than 13 for the legal regulations here, and older than 18 to see images marked as NSFW. If you're under 18 please ask your parents or legal tutors.
          {"\n\n"}
          We will also store your registration IP, your last login ip and the ip that you use when you upload a media like pic or video, so if you post something illegal we can comply with the authorities.
          {"\n\n"}
          If your account does not get activated in a period between a month and a year it might get deleted.
          {"\n\n"}
          If you want to get all the data we have about you, or there is any problem regarding the GDPR please email us at info@wafrn.net. This is a manual process and can take some time.
